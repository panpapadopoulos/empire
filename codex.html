  <div class="prose"><p>In the name of the Empire, of the Sovereign Kingdom of the Two Crowns, and of the Eternal Seat of Order,</p>
<p>We, the Supreme Thrones and the united peoples under their dominion, do hereby enact this Constitution as the supreme and binding law of the land.</p>
<p>Founded upon the sacred legacy of the Crowned Bird and the wisdom of the Ancients, this document establishes the divine doctrine of governance, the harmony of order and freedom, and the inviolable duties of ruler and subject.</p>
<p>Let this Constitution be the unbreakable covenant between throne and citizen, forged in justice, preserved in honor, and transmitted in the name of peace, sovereignty, and imperial truth — now and for all generations to come.</p></div>

  <div class="h2">History of the Empire</div>
  
<div class="post">
  <h4>Once upon a time…</h4>
  <p>There were two villages: <b>VillageA</b>, founded by <b>Lishhhhmm</b>, and <b>VillageB</b>, led by <b>panosusa</b>. The two villages were located very close to each other, separated only by a short sea passage.</p>
  <p>As they developed, the two leaders decided to unite their efforts and establish a joint industry, aiming to boost their production. The industry was built in VillageB due to its vast available space, in contrast to VillageA, which was located on a small island and lacked the necessary geographical capacity.</p>
  <p>This decision led to rapid development and significant economic power. For better management, a unified administrative center was established in VillageB, and the residents of VillageA gradually relocated there. To create the needed space, part of VillageB had to be demolished. The two villages were now united into what became known as <b>The City</b>, governed jointly by the two leaders.</p>
</div>
<div class="hr"></div>
<div class="post">
  <h4>Exploration</h4>
  <p>The two leaders frequently sent expeditions to explore the surrounding regions. On one such mission, a relatively underdeveloped village was discovered. After discussions between the expedition members and the local leadership, there was a clear interest in the industrial and administrative system of the City.</p>
  <p>Formal negotiations quickly began, with the goal of integrating this third village into the industrial collaboration. Soon, the City’s two leaders, Lishhhhmm and panosusa, formed a proposal that built upon industrial cooperation and expanded it into an administrative union — leading to the foundation of an Empire.</p>
</div>
<div class="hr"></div>
<div class="post">
  <h4>The Proposal</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Full access to the goods produced by the common industry, in exchange for a commitment to participate in the production process.</li>
    <li>The City would provide the necessary infrastructure and expertise for the production tasks assigned to the new village.</li>
    <li>Due to the greater investment made by the City, a core requirement of the agreement was the administrative unification of the villages and the proclamation of an Empire.</li>
    <li>The two leaders of the City would be recognized as the sole and equal Emperors of the Empire.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="hr"></div>
<div class="post">
  <h4>Requirements for Entry</h4>
  <p>Any Village / Region / City / Duchy wishing to join must:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Appoint a Duke as the local leader of the area.</li>
    <li>Possess, at a minimum, the following infrastructure:
      <ul>
        <li>5 houses</li>
        <li>Central administrative building</li>
        <li>Central goods repository</li>
        <li>Central station</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Operate, maintain, and develop the assigned production infrastructure, ensuring the minimum required production levels are met.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The leader of the third village accepted the proposal during an official event held in the City, and thus, the Empire was born. Immediately, work began on drafting a constitution, which was signed by the newly crowned Emperors.</p>
  <p><b>A Golden Age had begun for all.</b></p>
